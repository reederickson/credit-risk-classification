# credit-risk-classification
In this Challenge, I used various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. I used a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

Found in the credit_risk_classification.ipynb, I split the data into Training and Testing sets, created a logistic regression model with the original data, and generated a confusion matrix with classification report to be used in analysis. In the Credit Risk Report markdown, there is an overview of the analysis explaining its purpose, a bulleted list describing the results, and a summary that includes justification for reccomending the model. 

I utilized in class examples to complete this assignment, as well as outside knowledge of how loans and credit reporting functions.
